# I have a question!

Before you post a Github issue or send an email ensure you've done this checklist:

1. [Determined scope](https://caseontology.org/ontology/start.html#scope) of your task. It is not necessary for most parties to understand all aspects of the ontology, mapping methods, and supporting tools.
2. Search the [Issues tab](https://github.com/casework/CASE/issues) for duplicative issues.  Please know, however, that the CASE community primarily tracks issues in a Jira instance available to community members.  The Github Issue tracker can still be a way CASE issues are reported by users who have not registered with the community, but work on the issues will be scheduled and tracked in Jira.
